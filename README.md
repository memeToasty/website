My personal website - with Prolog backend
## Plans
I intend to expand the Prolog backend to do something more interesting than just serving static files.
Currently there is no idea to what this would be, but if you have an idea for me, just let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/memeToasty/website/issues)
## Requirements
The only thing required is the SWI-Prolog (*swipl*) interpreter.
## Credits
The source of the static Prolog server is [swipl-webapp-howto](https://github.com/roblaing/swipl-webapp-howto/tree/master/unit1)
